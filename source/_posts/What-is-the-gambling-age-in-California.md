Different gambling ages in California are set by the California Gambling Control Commission (CGCC). The legal age to gamble in California is 21. This is the age at which a person can gamble at a casino, place a bet on a horse race, or purchase a lottery ticket.

There are some exceptions to the 21-year-old rule. Those include bingo games offered by charities and Indian tribes, as well as social gaming activities that take place in someone’s home. In those cases, players must be 18 years of age or older to participate.

The CGCC also sets minimum and maximum ages for people who work in the gambling industry. Employees of casinos and other gambling establishments must be at least 18 years old. However, there is no maximum age for casino employees. They can continue to work as long as they meet all other job requirements.

#  What is the legal gambling age in California?

In the state of California, the legal gambling age is 21. This is set by the state government and applies to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lotteries, and sports betting.

The reasoning behind this age limit is largely to protect young people from developing addictive behaviors. Gambling can be an extremely addictive activity, and studies have shown that people under the age of 21 are more likely to become addicted than those over 21.

There are some exceptions to the age limit in California. For example, minors can participate in bingo and raffles if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. And there are some tribal casinos that allow gambling by people as young as 18.

But in general, the legal gambling age in California is 21. Anyone caught violating this rule can face penalties, including fines and possible imprisonment.

The minimum gambling age in California is 18.

#  What is the maximum gambling age in California?

The legal gambling age in California is 21 years old. This applies to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lottery tickets, and bingo.

California is one of a number of states that have set the legal gambling age at 21. The majority of states have set the age at 18 or 19, while a few have higher ages of 24 or 25.

There are some exceptions to the general rule. For example, the state allows 18-year-olds to gamble on horse races. There are also some tribal casinos that allow people as young as 18 to gamble.

Many people think that the legal gambling age should be lowered to help protect younger people from addiction and other risks associated with gambling. However, there is little evidence that shows that a lower age would be effective in reducing these risks. In fact, research suggests that young people who gamble are more likely to develop problems with gambling later in life.

Ultimately, it is up to each state to decide what the legal gambling age should be. If you are unsure about the age requirements in your state, it is best to check with a lawyer or regulatory agency.
