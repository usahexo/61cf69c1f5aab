# How to Deal Blackjack Switch

Blackjack Switch is a popular variation of the classic game of blackjack. It is played with two hands instead of one, and the player has the option to switch cards between the two hands. As a dealer, it is important to know how to deal this game properly. In this article, we will discuss the rules of Blackjack Switch and how to deal it effectively.

## Blackjack Switch Rules

Before we discuss how to deal the game, let's review the rules of Blackjack Switch:

1. Blackjack Switch is played with six to eight decks of cards.
2. Players are dealt two hands and can switch the second card of each hand if they desire.
3. A natural blackjack pays even money instead of the usual 3:2 payout.
4. The dealer must hit on a soft 17.
5. The dealer peeks for blackjack if they have an Ace or a 10-value card.
6. If the dealer has a blackjack, all player hands lose, except for those that have a natural blackjack.
7. If the player has a total of 21, it is not considered a blackjack unless it is a natural blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card).
8. Players can double down on any two cards.
9. Players can also double down after splitting.
10. Players can split up to four hands, except for Aces which can only be split once.
11. Players can also hit and double down on split Aces.

## Dealing Blackjack Switch

Now that we know the rules of Blackjack Switch, let's discuss how to deal the game:

1. The dealer shuffles the cards and places them in the shoe.
2. The dealer asks the players to place their bets.
3. The dealer deals two face-up cards to each player and two face-down cards to themselves.
4. The dealer then asks each player if they want to switch the second card of each hand.
5. Once all players have made their decisions, the dealer reveals their face-down cards.
6. If the dealer has a natural blackjack, they will immediately collect all losing player bets, except for those with a natural blackjack, which will be pushed.
7. If the dealer does not have a blackjack, they will proceed to play their hand according to the rules.
8. The dealer will then pay out the winning bets and collect the losing bets.

It is important for the dealer to keep a steady pace while dealing Blackjack Switch. Since there are two hands per player, the game can move slower than traditional blackjack. It is also important for the dealer to be aware of the players who wish to switch cards between their hands.

## Conclusion

Blackjack Switch is a fun and exciting variation of the classic game of blackjack. As a dealer, it is important to know the rules of the game and how to deal it effectively. By following these guidelines, you will be able to provide an enjoyable gaming experience for your players.
