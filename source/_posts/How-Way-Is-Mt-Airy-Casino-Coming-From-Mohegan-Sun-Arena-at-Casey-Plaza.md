#  How is Mt Airy Casino's Move from Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza?

Mt. Airy Casino Resort is suing the Mohegan Sun Pocono casino for $10 million, alleging that the rival casino has interfered with its plans to move from the Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza in Wilkes-Barre, PA to a new $100 million casino and entertainment complex in Plains Township.

The suit, filed in federal court in Scranton on Wednesday, claims that Mohegan Sun Pocono has unfairly blocked Mt. Airy from obtaining necessary permits and approvals for the project.

“Mohegan Sun Pocono has engaged in a pattern of unlawful conduct designed to frustrate and prevent Mount Airy from developing its proposed new facility,” the lawsuit reads.

A spokesman for Mohegan Sun Pocono said the company would not comment on pending litigation.

Mt. Airy Casino Resort has been based at the Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza since 2007, when it purchased the property from then-owner Harrah’s Entertainment. The property includes a hotel, a 2,000-seat concert hall, and an 84,000-square-foot casino floor.

In October 2017, Mt. Airy announced plans to build a new $100 million casino and entertainment complex on a 58-acre site just off Interstate 81 in Plains Township. The project would include a 150,000-square-foot casino floor, a hotel, restaurants and retail space.

The planned move has been opposed by many residents of Plains Township and Wilkes-Barre who are concerned about increased traffic and crime that the new casino would bring to the area. In May 2018, the Wilkes-Barre City Council passed a resolution opposing the Mt. Airy Casino Resort’s plan to move to Plains Township.

In its lawsuit against Mohegan Sun Pocono, Mt. Airy claims that the rival casino has used its influence with state officials “to create or exacerbate permitting delays and hurdles which have prevented Mount Airy from timely commencing construction of its new facility as intended”

#  Moving Day for Mt. Airy Casino from Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza

The Mt. Airy casino will be relocating from the Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza to a new facility in Dupont, PA. The new casino is expected to open in 2020. The relocation was announced on Wednesday, June 19th.

Mt. Airy Casino Resort President Eric Trump said that the decision to relocate was based on the need for a larger and more modern facility. The new casino will have 400,000 square feet of gaming space, compared to the current property's 125,000 square feet. The new casino will also have a hotel with 500 guest rooms and suites, a spa, and several restaurants.

In addition to the larger facility, the new casino will also offer better amenities and features for guests. These include high-limit gaming areas, private gaming salons, and luxury lounges. There will also be a bigger and better events center that can accommodate up to 3,000 people.

Construction on the new casino is expected to start in early 2020. The $330 million project is scheduled to be completed in 18 months. Once it is open, the Mt. Airy Casino Resort will move its operations there.

The Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza opened in 2007 as part of a joint venture between Mohegan Gaming & Entertainment and AEG Worldwide. It is home to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins hockey team and has hosted many other events over the years, including concerts, rodeos, and monster truck rallies.

#  Mt. Airy Casino Leaving Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza

A casino that has been a mainstay in the Wilkes-Barre area for more than two decades is leaving.

Mt. Airy Casino Resort officials confirmed Wednesday the casino will no longer be operable at Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza in Wilkes-Barre.

The news comes as a surprise to many, as the casino has been a presence in the area since 1997.

In a statement, officials said the decision was made due to "a number of challenges that have arisen in the last few years."

"It is with great sadness that we announce our departure from Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza," Mt. Airy CEO Bill McDevitt said in a statement. "This was not an easy decision to make, but it is one that we believe is necessary for the future of our company."

Mt. Airy officials did not elaborate on what specific challenges led to the decision.

The casino employs about 500 people and its departure will leave about 300 people without jobs, according to McDevitt. He said the company plans to offer those employees positions at its other properties. 
Wilkes-Barre Mayor Tony George said he was "shocked" by the news and "disappointed" in how it was handled. 
"I'm just really disappointed with how this whole thing went down," George said. "I think there could have been a better way to do it." 

Mt. Airy's departure will leave only one gaming establishment remaining in Luzerne County — Mohegan Sun Pocono in Plains Township.
