#  Who's Hefty? These Comedians Are!

Standup is all about making people laugh, and sometimes that means pushing boundaries. For Hefty comedians, that means taking their act to the next level by incorporating weight jokes into their routine. Here are some of the funniest heavy comedians around.

1. Ron Pearson

Ron Pearson is a standup comedian and actor who has been performing since the early 1990s. He's well-known for his physical comedy, and many of his jokes involve his weight. In one bit, he talks about how his large size makes it difficult for him to find clothes that fit, and in another, he discusses the challenges of being a big guy in a world that seems designed for smaller people. Pearson's humor is relatable and often self-deprecating, which makes him one of the most popular heavies on the comedy circuit today.

2. Luenell

Luenell got her start in standup comedy by performing at open mics in Los Angeles in the early 2000s. She quickly gained a following due to her unique brand of humor, which often revolves around her weight and her experiences as a black woman in America. Luenell is fearless when it comes to tackling taboo subjects like race and sex, and she's not afraid to make fun of herself or her fellowHeavy comics. Her no-holds-barred approach has made her one of the most respected comedians in the industry.

3. John Pinette

John Pinette was a popular standup comedian whose routines often focused on his weight struggles. In one famous bit, he describes how he once lost over 100 pounds but then regained it all back again due to poor eating habits. Pinette was known for his frankness when talking about his body image issues, and his hilarious stories always seemed to end on a positive note. Tragically, Pinette passed away in 2014 after suffering a heart attack onstage; however, his legacy will always be remembered as one of the funniest heavies in history.

4. Mike DeStefano

Mike DeStefano is an American comic who got his start in standup during the 1990s. His act is based largely on personal anecdotes from his life, many of which involve his weight issues.
