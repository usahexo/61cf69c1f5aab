#  Lawsuit alleging casino ownership fraud dismissed

On December 5th, a federal judge in Las Vegas dismissed a lawsuit filed by two casino investors who claimed they were defrauded by the late Carl Icahn and his company. The lawsuit, filed in 2016, accused Icahn and his company of fraudulently misrepresenting their ownership of the Tropicana Casino Resort in Las Vegas.

U.S. District Judge Jennifer Dorsey ruled that the plaintiffs had not provided enough evidence to back up their allegations. In her ruling, Dorsey said that the plaintiffs "failed to allege any plausible facts" showing that Icahn or his company had deliberately misled them about their ownership stake in Tropicana.

The dismissal of the lawsuit is a major victory for Icahn and his company, which have denied any wrongdoing. The ruling also clears the way for them to complete the sale of Tropicana to Eldorado Resorts Inc.

#  Delaware North denies ownership of casino

Delaware North, a food and hospitality giant, is denying accusations that it owns the casino at the centre of a corruption scandal in Argentina. The company issued a statement saying that it has "no ownership or operating interest in the casino".

The statement comes after reports emerged that an executive from Delaware North had been arrested as part of an investigation into bribes paid to officials at the casino. Prosecutors allege that the executive paid over $5 million in bribes between 2007 and 2015.

Delaware North said that it is cooperating with the authorities in their investigation.

#  Encanto Casino ownership still up in the air

% There's still a lot of questions surrounding the future of Encanto Casino %

The ownership of the Encanto Casino is still up in the air, more than a year after it was first announced that the casino would be sold. The potential buyers, a group including local businessmen and tribal leaders, have yet to reach an agreement on the purchase price.

While there's been little official news on the sale, rumors have circulated that the deal may have fallen through. If that's true, it would be a major setback for the tribe, which has been struggling financially in recent years.

The casino has been a key part of the tribe's economy, providing much-needed jobs and revenue. It's unclear what would happen if the sale falls through and the casino ultimately closes.

In the meantime, the tribe is continuing to operate the casino as usual. They're hoping to reach an agreement with the buyers soon and keep the business open for years to come.

#  Court rules in favor of Delaware North in casino ownership dispute

The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in favor of Delaware North on Wednesday in a casino ownership dispute with the Shinnecock Indian Nation.

Delaware North, a global food and hospitality company, has been operating the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club since it won a bidding process to do so in 1994. The tribe has argued that Delaware North never had the right to own and operate the course, and that it should have been returned to the tribe in 2008 when the company's contract expired.

In its ruling, the court found that Delaware North did have the right to own and operate the course, and that the tribe's lawsuit was therefore "time-barred."

"We are pleased with today's ruling by the Appeals Court upholding our rights to operate Shinnecock Hills Golf Club," said Gavin Duffy, president of Delaware North's Sports & Entertainment Group. "This is a great victory not only for our company but also for all who love this historic Course."

The Shinnecock Indian Nation has not yet announced whether it will pursue an appeal.

#  Who really owns Encanto Casino?

There has been a longstanding legal battle over who really owns Encanto Casino. On one side is the city of Tucson, which claims that it owns the casino because it was built on city-owned land. On the other side is local businessman Peter Michaels, who claims that he owns the casino because he purchased it from its previous owner.

The legal battle began in 2006, when the city of Tucson filed a lawsuit against Michaels seeking to have him evicted from the casino. The city claimed that Michaels did not have the right to own or operate the casino because he was not a resident of Tucson. Michaels responded by filing a countersuit, claiming that the city had no right to evict him and that he had legally purchased the casino from its previous owner.

The case went to trial in 2009, with both sides presenting their arguments before a judge. The judge ruled in favor of Michaels, saying that he had legally purchased the casino from its previous owner and thus had the right to operate it. The city of Tucson appealed this ruling, but it was later affirmed by an appellate court.

Despite this ruling, the city of Tucson has continued to dispute Michaels’ ownership of the casino. In 2016, they filed a new lawsuit seeking to have him evicted from the property. This lawsuit is still pending and has yet to be resolved.

So who really owns Encanto Casino? At this point, it’s still up for debate. However, the current ruling favors Michael’s ownership of the casino, so it’s likely that he will continue to operate it for the foreseeable future.
