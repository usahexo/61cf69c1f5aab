#  Real Madrid CF's Online Activities Betting Operation is a Major Success

The Real Madrid CF’s online activities betting operation is said to be a major success, with the club generating millions of euros in revenue. The Blancos became the first Spanish top-flight football club to offer its own online betting service in November 2017.

Revenue from the venture is said to have already surpassed that generated by the sale of naming rights for the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, and kit sponsorship deals. In its first year of operation, the website generated €30 million in revenue.

The Blancos’ website offers a wide range of services, including sports betting, casino games, virtual sports and bingo. It is available in 10 different languages and has over 1 million registered users.

A spokesperson for the club said: “Real Madrid CF has become a benchmark in Europe for launching an online platform dedicated to sport betting and gaming. Our site offers users an unbeatable experience when it comes to quality and gameplay options.”

The Blancos are not the only Spanish top-flight football club to offer an online betting service. FC Barcelona also has its own website, which was launched in 2009. However, Real Madrid’s website is said to be far more successful, with Barcelona generating just €4 million from its betting operations in 2018.
