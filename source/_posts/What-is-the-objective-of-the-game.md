#  What is the objective of the game?

The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by taking control of territories on the map and then defending them from other players. Players can gain points by occupying and developing territories, as well as by capturing and holding city tiles. The game ends when one player has control of all of the territories on the map, or when another player reaches the winning score.

# How do players take control of territories?

Players can take control of a territory by occupying it with one of their pieces, and then either expanding into it or developing it. When a player occupies a territory, they place one of their pieces in the center of the territory. The player then has two options: they can either expand into the territory by placing another piece next to one of their pieces, or develop the territory by placing a development tile in it. If a player expands into a territory, they claim it for themselves and gain control of it. If a player develops a territory, they add to that territory's population and gain control of it.

# How do players capture and hold city tiles?

Players can capture and hold city tiles by occupying them with one of their pieces and then either expanding into them or developing them. When a player occupies a city tile, they place one of their pieces in the center of the tile. The player then has two options: they can either expand into the tile by placing another piece next to one of their pieces, or develop the tile by placing a development tile in it. If a player expands into a city tile, they claim it for themselves and gain control of it. If a player develops a city tile, they add to that city's population and gain control of it. In addition, if a player controls at least three city tiles on the map, they automatically win the game.
