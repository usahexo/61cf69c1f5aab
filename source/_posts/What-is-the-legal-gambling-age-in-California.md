#  What is the legal gambling age in California?

 Californians can start gambling at the age of 18. This is because gambling is considered an adult activity in California. There are some casinos that allow people aged 21 or older to gamble, but the majority of casinos in California allow players aged 18 and up.

While 18 may be the legal gambling age in California, there are some important things to keep in mind before hitting the casino floor. First, always gamble responsibly and within your budget. Second, know the odds before you bet. Finally, be aware of the signs of gambling addiction and seek help if needed.

If you are looking for a fun night out and want to try your luck at the casino, then be sure to visit one of the many casinos in California that allow players aged 18 and up. Have fun and good luck!

#  How old do you have to be to gamble in California?

The legal gambling age in California is 18. This means that you must be at least 18 years old in order to gamble at a casino, place bets on horse races, or play the lottery.

There are a few exceptions to this rule. If you are 18-21 years old, you may only gamble at a casino if you are accompanied by someone over 21 years old. And if you are under 18, you may only gamble in certain circumstances, such as at a racetrack where live racing is taking place.

It is important to note that just because the legal gambling age is 18 doesn’t mean that all casinos or betting establishments will let people under 21 gamble. In fact, many places have their own rules about what ages they will and will not allow. So always be sure to check before heading out to gamble.

If you are caught gambling underage, you could face fines and/or jail time. So it is definitely not worth it to take the chance – wait until you reach the legal age and enjoy gambling then!
