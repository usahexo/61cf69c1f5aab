The objective of the game is to travel around the real world, capturing different types of Pokemon using your phone's camera. As you progress in the game, you can battle others at "gyms" to gain control of them.

Since its release, "Pokemon GO" has been praised for getting people outside and interacting with their community. In fact, some people have even credited the game for helping them find new friends and connect with others who share their interests.

So far, North Africa has seen great success with "Pokemon GO". The first country in the region to get the game was Tunisia on July 13th. Algeria followed soon after on July 20th, and Morocco on July 22nd. Egypt was the last country to join the group on August 2nd.

#  Bingo Arrives in Tunisia: What does this Mean for the Future?

On November 9th, 2018, the Tunisian National Lottery announced the launch of its new bingo game, becoming the latest country in the Arab world to offer the popular casino game. The debut of bingo in Tunisia has generated a great deal of excitement among players and industry observers alike, with many heralding it as a sign of burgeoning growth in the Tunisian gaming market.

While it is still too early to say for certain, the arrival of bingo in Tunisia could potentially pave the way for even more gambling opportunities in the country. For example, there is speculation that other casino games such as blackjack and roulette may soon be introduced as well. This would give Tunisian players even more options when it comes to spending their leisure time and gambling money.

One potential obstacle facing Tunisian gaming operators is an existing monopoly held by state-owned company SONASID. SONASID currently offers a limited selection of games including lottery, scratch cards, and instant win games. It is unclear how Bingo will be integrated into SONASID's current offerings, or if a separate entity will be established to manage it.

Regardless of how things shake out, it is clear that the arrival of bingo in Tunisia is a major development that could have far-reaching consequences for the future of the gaming market in the country.
