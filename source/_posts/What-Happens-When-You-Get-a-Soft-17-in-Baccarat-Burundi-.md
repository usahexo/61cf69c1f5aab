#  What Is Considered A Soft 17 In Baccarat? 

A soft 17 in Baccarat is a hand consisting of an ace and six. This hand is considered weaker than other hands because it has a low point count of only seven. Some players may choose to take a hit on a soft 17, while others may stand pat. It all depends on the individual's strategy and what they feel gives them the best chance of winning.

#  What Are The Odds Of Getting A Soft 17 In Baccarat? 

In baccarat, the player has three potential outcomes: winning, losing, and a tie. Winning pays out at even money, losing pays out at 1 to 1, and a tie pays out at 8 to 1. The goal of the game is to get as close to 9 as possible; if the player’s hand total is greater than 9, the excess is subtracted from 10. So a hand total of 11 would be counted as 1.

The two dominant bets in baccarat are betting on the player or on the banker. The banker bet has a very small edge over the player bet, but it isn’t as large as the house edge in games such as blackjack and roulette. In order to make a banker bet, the player must first place a wager on either the player or banker positions. The bank then takes two cards for itself and two cards for the player—one face up and one face down. If either the player or banker has an 8 or 9, that hand is considered a “natural” and no further cards are drawn. If neither hand is an 8 or 9, then one more card is drawn for each hand and the highest value card is used to determine the winner. Aces are worth 1, 2 through 10 are worth their face value, and a jack, queen or king (representing 10) are all worth 0 points.
