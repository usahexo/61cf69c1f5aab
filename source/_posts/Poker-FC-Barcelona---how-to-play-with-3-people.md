#  Poker FC Barcelona - how to play with 3 people

If you love football and poker, there's no better way to combine the two than by playing Poker FC Barcelona. This three-player game is based on the classic Five Card draw poker, but with a few twists that make it even more exciting.

To begin, each player is dealt five cards face down. The player to the left of the dealer begins the hand by choosing one of their cards to discard and place face up in the middle of the table. The next player then has two choices: either take the card in the middle or select one of their own cards to discard and put in the middle. This process continues until each player has either taken a card from the middle or discarded one of their own.

Once all players have chosen a card, they then take turns betting on who they think will win the hand. The player who started the hand starts first and can either bet or check (similar to folding in other poker games). The next player then either raises, if they think they have a good hand, or calls if they're happy with their cards. Play then proceeds as normal, with players betting and raising until one player either declares they're all in or folds. The winning player takes both pots - the main pot and any side pots that may have been created during the hand.

So how do you play Poker FC Barcelona? It's actually quite simple - just follow these steps:

1) Deal five cards to each player face down, clockwise from left to right.
2) Player to left of dealer starts by discarding one card and placing it face up in centre of table 
3) Next player can either take face up card in centre or discard one off their cards and replace with face up card 
4) Play passes clockwise around table with players taking turn discarding one card at a time until all players are down to one card 
5) At this point each player must decide whether to keep their card or put it in the middle to form a new deck for next hand 
6) Players now bet on who they think will win hand - starting first with player who started discarding first 
7) Betting proceeds as normal until one player either goes all-in or fold s 
8) Winner takes both pots - main pot and any side pots

#  How to play Poker FC Barcelona with 5 people

The game of Poker FC Barcelona is a highly popular card game that can be enjoyed by up to 5 people. The game can be played with a regular deck of 52 cards, and the aim of the game is to collect as many poker hands as possible.

The player who begins the game is known as the dealer, and they are responsible for dealing out the cards to each player. The dealer then sets aside one card, which is known as the burn card. The rest of the deck is then placed in the middle of the players, and each player takes it in turns to draw one card from the deck.

Once all of the players have been dealt their cards, it’s time for them to start making poker hands. In Poker FC Barcelona, there are a number of different poker hands that can be made, including pairs, three of a kind, two pairs, four of a kind, straight, flush and full house.

If a player has more than one card that can make a particular poker hand, they will usually keep the best card in their hand. For example, if they have two sixes, they will keep the six that gives them the best chance of winning. If there is a tie between two or more cards in a player’s hand, then they will both be counted as part of that poker hand.

The player who collects the most poker hands at the end of the game wins!

Barcelona is a great city to visit, but it’s even better if you have friends to share the experience with. Fortunately, poker is the perfect game to play with a group of people, and Barcelona is home to some of the best poker rooms in Europe. Here’s the best way to play poker in Barcelona with seven people.

First, pick a location. There are plenty of great bars and restaurants in Barcelona that offer private rooms for large groups. If you want to stay close to the action, try one of the casino hotels like Casino Barcelona or Gran Casino de Catalunya. These casinos offer poker rooms that can accommodate groups of up to twelve people.

If you want to save a little money, there are several fine restaurants near La Rambla that offer private rooms for large groups at reasonable prices. One option is Can Culleretes, which is famous for its Catalan cuisine.

Once you’ve picked a location, it’s time to start assembling your poker team. If you have friends who are familiar with Barcelona, they’re probably already well-acquainted with the city’s poker scene. But if you need some help finding players, there are plenty of online resources available.

There are several websites where you can find people who want to join a game or even start their own game. PokerMeetup is one such site, and it has an extensive listing of meetups and games happening in Barcelona and all over Spain.

Now that you have your players lined up, it’s time to plan the game itself. Texas Hold ‘Em is the most popular form of poker, but don’t be afraid to experiment with other variants like Omaha or Stud Poker.

No matter what variant you choose, make sure everyone knows the basic rules before starting play. There’s nothing more frustrating than spending an evening playing poker only to have someone demand a rules refresher course in the middle of the game!

Once you have the game sorted out, it’s time to set some ground rules. Here are some tips for a smooth and fun game:


	 	 Agree on a buy-in amount before starting play – this will prevent any arguments later on about who owes what

	 	 Decide on a schedule early on – especially if some members of your party want to get up early or go to bed early



	 	 Keep track of everyone’s chip count – this will make things easier when it comes time to settle up

	 	 Have fun! Poker is meant to be enjoyed with friends, so relax and enjoy yourself

#  Playing Poker FC Barcelona with 9 players 

In this poker game, there is an initial pot of 9 coins (represented by the number 9 in the diagram below). The first player to act is the one with the highest card and so on. The player with the 2 of clubs starts the game.

2 of Clubs 
3 of Clubs 
4 of Clubs 
5 of Clubs 
6 of Clubs 
7 of Clubs 
8 of Clubs 
9 of Spades 
10 of Spades

The 3 and 4 are then played, as well as the 5 and 6. The 7 and 8 are then played, as well as the 9 and 10. At this point, there are only two cards left in the deck- the Ace of Diamonds and the 2nd highest card- which is a Queen of Spades. The Queen is higher than the Ace, so it goes to the next player who then has to play one card. If they have a card higher than the Queen, they can continue playing; if not, their turn ends and they must forfeit their bet.
























The 3 beats the 4 (since 3 is higher than 4), so the next player must play a card. The 5 beats the 6 (since 5 is higher than 6), so the next player must play a card. The 7 does not beat 8 (since 7 is lower than 8), so the turn passes to next player. The 9 beats 10 (since 9 is higher than 10), so next player must play one card. If they have 10 orHigher ,they continue playing, but if not their turn over and they lose there bet

#  10 People Can Play Poker FC Barcelona

Poker is not a new game and there are many variations of it. Texas hold'em is perhaps the most popular one, both among amateurs and pros. The game involves playing with a deck of 52 cards and making different combinations with five of them in order to win the pot. In order to play poker, you need at least two people, but there is no maximum number of players - poker can be played with 10 people just as easily as with two.

The game starts by each player being given two cards face down, which are their hole cards. These are not revealed to anyone else at this point in the game. The rest of the deck is placed face down in the middle of all the players, and this is called the flop. Then, one card at a time is revealed from the top of the deck and placed next to the flop - this is called the turn. The final card, which is also placed next to the flop, is called the river.

Now it's time for players to start betting. Each player can either bet or check (which means they pass on betting for that particular round). If everyone checks, then the next player in turn can either bet or fold (which means they give up their hand and don't contribute anything to the pot). When someone bets, all other players have to decide whether to raise (match the amount of money that has been bet), call (match the amount of money that has been bet) or fold. The last player standing wins the pot.

Texas hold'em can be a very complicated game, but here are some basic tips for beginners:

- Pay attention to what other players are doing. If everyone seems to be folding except for one person, then that person probably has a good hand and you should fold too!

- Try not to reveal your cards until you have to - especially if you're fairly certain you're going to win. If other players know what type of card you have, they might raise or call depending on how strong they think their hand is.

- Be aware of how much money other players have left - if someone keeps raising, it might be worth folding your hand even if you think it's a good one.
