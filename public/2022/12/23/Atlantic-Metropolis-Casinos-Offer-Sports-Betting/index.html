In fact, the city’s casinos can trace their origins back to the early 1970s, when New Jersey became the first state in the nation to legalize gambling. This proved to be a boon for the city’s casino industry, and business continued to flourish in Atlantic City even after other states began legalizing gambling.</p>

<p>Casino executives welcomed the new development, which is expected to provide a much-needed boost to Atlantic City’s gaming industry. For years, casinos in Las Vegas have reaped the benefits of legalized sports betting while Atlantic City has fallen behind.</p>
<p>Now that sports betting is coming to Atlantic City, there are some important things gamblers need to know. First and foremost, you must be at least 21 years old to place a bet. In addition, there are several restrictions on what types of bets can be placed.</p>
<p>For example, you cannot bet on NCAA games if your team is involved. You also cannot bet on any game that takes place in New Jersey or any other state where sports betting is illegal. Finally, you are not allowed to place a bet greater than $1,000 per game or event.</p>
<p>Despite these restrictions, there are still plenty of opportunities for gamblers to make money off of their favorite teams. With NFL and NBA seasons in full swing, now is an opportune time to get into sports betting. The sooner you learn the ropes, the more likely you are to come out ahead.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for getting started:</p>
<p>– Do your research. Before placing a bet, be sure to do your homework and understand the ins and outs of the sport you’re betting on. This includes understanding the odds and how they work.</p>
<p>– Start small. It’s always best to start small when wagering your hard-earned money. Don’t go all-in on your first bet – instead, try making smaller wagers and increase them over time as you gain more experience.</p>
<p>– Use reputable sources. When looking for information about upcoming games or events, be sure to stick with reputable sources like ESPN or CBS Sportsline. These organizations employ experts who have a deep understanding of sports gambling and will give you accurate information so you can make informed decisions about your bets.</p>

Sports books are now reporting that they are seeing an increase in business as people make bets on their favorite teams.</p>
<p>Many casinos have added sports betting to their menus in order to take advantage of this new market. Caesars Palace, Bally’s, and Harrah’s all now offer sports betting, and more casino are sure to follow suit.</p>
<p>In addition to the casinos, there are also a number of off-track betting facilities located in Atlantic City that are taking advantage of the new opportunity. These facilities allow people to place bets on horses races that are not taking place at the time.</p>
<p>This is a major shift for the Atlantic City casino industry, which has been struggling in recent years. The addition of sports betting is likely to help revive interest in these casinos, and could help them regain some of the ground they have lost.</p>
