        <h1 id="What-is-the-objective-of-the-game"><a href="#What-is-the-objective-of-the-game" class="headerlink" title="What is the objective of the game?"></a>What is the objective of the game?</h1><p>The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by taking control of territories on the map and then defending them from other players. Players can gain points by occupying and developing territories, as well as by capturing and holding city tiles. The game ends when one player has control of all of the territories on the map, or when another player reaches the winning score.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-players-take-control-of-territories"><a href="#How-do-players-take-control-of-territories" class="headerlink" title="How do players take control of territories?"></a>How do players take control of territories?</h1><p>Players can take control of a territory by occupying it with one of their pieces, and then either expanding into it or developing it. When a player occupies a territory, they place one of their pieces in the center of the territory. The player then has two options: they can either expand into the territory by placing another piece next to one of their pieces, or develop the territory by placing a development tile in it. If a player expands into a territory, they claim it for themselves and gain control of it. If a player develops a territory, they add to that territory’s population and gain control of it.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-players-capture-and-hold-city-tiles"><a href="#How-do-players-capture-and-hold-city-tiles" class="headerlink" title="How do players capture and hold city tiles?"></a>How do players capture and hold city tiles?</h1><p>Players can capture and hold city tiles by occupying them with one of their pieces and then either expanding into them or developing them. When a player occupies a city tile, they place one of their pieces in the center of the tile. The player then has two options: they can either expand into the tile by placing another piece next to one of their pieces, or develop the tile by placing a development tile in it. If a player expands into a city tile, they claim it for themselves and gain control of it. If a player develops a city tile, they add to that city’s population and gain control of it. In addition, if a player controls at least three city tiles on the map, they automatically win the game.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-you-play-the-game"><a href="#How-do-you-play-the-game" class="headerlink" title="How do you play the game?"></a>How do you play the game?</h1><p>There are a lot of different ways to play the game, and it really just depends on what you’re looking for in a game. Some people like to play competitively, trying to get as many points as possible and rank higher on the leaderboard. Others enjoy the more casual gameplay, taking their time and exploring the different areas. No matter how you want to play, there’s always someone out there willing to match your style.</p>
<p>To start playing, you first need to find other players. The easiest way is to join one of the many public servers that are available. From there, it’s just a matter of finding someone who is ready to start a new game. To do this, simply click on the “Create Game” button and select the type of game you want to play.</p>

<h1 id="How-do-I-win"><a href="#How-do-I-win" class="headerlink" title="How do I win?"></a>How do I win?</h1><p>There are a few different ways that you can win the game, but it ultimately depends on what type of game you’re playing. In some cases, you simply need to reach the end of the level first. Other games may require you to collect a certain number of items or defeat all of the enemies in order to win. It really just depends on the scenario that you’re playing in.</p>
