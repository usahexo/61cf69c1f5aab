        <h1 id="Houston-Astros-Sold-to-Texas-Rangers"><a href="#Houston-Astros-Sold-to-Texas-Rangers" class="headerlink" title="Houston Astros Sold to Texas Rangers"></a>Houston Astros Sold to Texas Rangers</h1><p>The Houston Astros were sold to the Texas Rangers on November 21, 2017. The $2.3 billion sale was the most expensive franchise sale in MLB history.</p>
<p>The Rangers will pay $1.675 billion for the team and its affiliated properties, which includes the Astros’ share of Comcast SportsNet Houston. The network was a key issue in the purchase, as it has been mired in litigation between the Astros and their former cable providers since its launch in 2013.</p>
<p>“I am really excited about this opportunity,” Rangers co-owner Ray Davis said in a statement. “We want to thank Drayton McLane and his family for all they have done for baseball and for the City of Houston. This is a great franchise that has tremendous upside potential both on and off the field. We are looking forward to becoming part of the Houston community and building on the Astros’ success over the past few years.”</p>
<p>Astros owner Drayton McLane, Jr., who bought the team in 1992, said he had been approached by several potential buyers over the years but ultimately chose to sell to his fellow Texans.</p>
<p>“I am extremely proud of our accomplishments during my time with the Astros and am confident that this new chapter for our organization will be as successful as our past ones,” McLane said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Rangers make their second move from Arlington since 2010 after buying Globe Life Park from city officials for $22 million.</p>
<h1 id="Los-Angeles-Dodgers-Purchase-Houston-Astros"><a href="#Los-Angeles-Dodgers-Purchase-Houston-Astros" class="headerlink" title="Los Angeles Dodgers Purchase Houston Astros"></a>Los Angeles Dodgers Purchase Houston Astros</h1><p>The LA Dodgers have made a huge purchase by buying the Houston Astros. The Astros have been struggling in the past few years, but this new acquisition could turn their luck around. The Dodgers are looking to dominate the league with this move and make it to the World Series.</p>
<p>The Houston Astros have been a part of the MLB since 1962, but they haven’t had much success in recent years. In fact, they’ve only made it to the playoffs twice in the last fifteen years. Their record isn’t too bad, but they haven’t been able to make it all the way to the championships.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the LA Dodgers have been doing pretty well for themselves. They’ve made it to the playoffs six times in the last fifteen years and even won two World Series titles. They’re looking to continue their dominance in the league and what better way to do that than by purchasing the Astros?</p>
<p>It’s unclear how this move will impact both teams, but we can expect some big changes from both sides. The Dodgers are now one of the biggest teams in the league, while the Astros are going to have to start working hard if they want to compete with them.</p>
<h1 id="Boston-Red-Sox-Buy-Houston-Astros"><a href="#Boston-Red-Sox-Buy-Houston-Astros" class="headerlink" title="Boston Red Sox Buy Houston Astros"></a>Boston Red Sox Buy Houston Astros</h1><p>Houston, we have a problem. The Boston Red Sox announced today that they have agreed to buy the Houston Astros.</p>
<p>Why would the Red Sox do this? There are a few theories. </p>
<p>The first theory is that the Red Sox want to become a dynasty and buy every team in their division. The Yankees have done this in the past, so it’s not outside the realm of possibility for the Red Sox.</p>
<p>Another theory is that the Red Sox want to move to Houston and they’re using the Astros as a way to get approval from the city. This theory seems a bit far-fetched, but it’s still possible.</p>
<p>The final theory is that the Red Sox just think that the Astros are a good team and they want to add them to their roster. This is definitely the most plausible theory, as it makes sense for the Red Sox to want to improve their team.</p>
<p>Regardless of why they did it, this move signals big changes for both teams. The Astros are now part of one of the toughest divisions in baseball, while the Red Sox have made themselves into an even bigger powerhouse. It will be interesting to see how these two teams fare in their new matchups.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-Yankees-Acquire-Houston-Astros"><a href="#New-York-Yankees-Acquire-Houston-Astros" class="headerlink" title="New York Yankees Acquire Houston Astros"></a>New York Yankees Acquire Houston Astros</h1><p>The New York Yankees are one of the most successful franchises in all of sports. The team has won 27 World Series championships and 40 American League pennants. However, the Yankees have not been to the playoffs since 2012 and have not won a World Series championship since 2009. This offseason, the Yankees made a move to improve their team by acquiring the Houston Astros.</p>
<p>The Astros are coming off of a 101-61 season, which was good enough for first place in the American League West division. The Astros had four players participate in the All-Star game, including Jose Altuve, Alex Bregman, George Springer, and Justin Verlander. They also had two players (Altuve and Springer) win Gold Glove Awards.</p>
<p>The Astros are led by manager A.J. Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow. The team has a young nucleus of players that should continue to improve in the coming years. The Yankees should be able to compete for a World Series championship with this acquisition.</p>
<h1 id="Chicago-Cubs-Snag-Houston-Astros-in-Upcoming-Trade"><a href="#Chicago-Cubs-Snag-Houston-Astros-in-Upcoming-Trade" class="headerlink" title="Chicago Cubs Snag Houston Astros in Upcoming Trade"></a>Chicago Cubs Snag Houston Astros in Upcoming Trade</h1><p>The Cubbies have been one of the busiest teams this offseason, making a big trade with the Astros on Thursday.</p>
<p>Houston will send outfielderAlec Hansen, infielderYuli Gurriel, and catcherBrian McCann to Chicago in exchange for pitchersRobel Garcia and Tyler Ihrig, outfielderDuncan Robinson, and first basemanTony Kemp.</p>
<p>This move signals that the Cubs are serious about competing in 2019. Hansen is one of the Astros’ top prospects, while Gurriel is coming off a strong season in which he hit .297 with 18 homers and 85 RBIs. McCann provides veteran leadership to Chicago’s young pitching staff.</p>
<p>For Houston, this trade frees up some playing time for youngsters like Robinson and Kemp. Garcia and Ihrig could help fill the void left by Dallas Keuchel and Charlie Morton, who both signed with the Atlanta Braves earlier this offseason.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how these two teams match up when they meet later this season. The Cubs are definitely improved after this trade, but the Astros are still a tough opponent.</p>
